## What is Bulldog Boombox?
Bulldog Boombox is an application for anyone who loves music! If you are sick and tired of YouTube creating a playlist for you that pulls songs from different genres, then we've got the fix for you!

Our dynamically created application pulls data related to songs and artists from 2 distinct server-side API's, last.fm and Wikipedia.
This data includes:
* Artist
* Title of Song
* Lyrics
* Information about the artist
* Ability to save your favorite songs that generate
